\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes the BurnLab web platform (Version \myversion). It defines the scope, features, constraints, and quality attributes required to design, implement, test, and operate BurnLab. This SRS covers the full system rather than a single subsystem.

\section{Document Conventions}
This SRS follows IEEE conventions for requirements documents (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018). Section numbering is hierarchical. Plain text conveys narrative descriptions; \textbf{bold} emphasizes key terms and priorities. Functional requirements are uniquely identified using the prefix \textbf{REQ-}\# (e.g., REQ-1). Unless explicitly stated otherwise, feature-level priorities are inherited by their detailed requirements. All requirement statements are complete, unambiguous sentences.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading}
Developers and testers should focus on \textbf{Chapter 3 (System Features)} for implementable behavior and test design. Project managers can use \textbf{Chapters 2–4} to track scope, priorities, and quality targets. Administrators and support staff can reference expected behaviors and constraints throughout. A suggested order is: \textbf{Chapter 1} (scope), \textbf{Chapter 2} (context), \textbf{Chapter 3} (functional details), then \textbf{Chapters 4–5} (nonfunctional qualities and other constraints).

\section{Product Scope}
BurnLab provides personalized fitness and nutrition planning alongside a marketplace for expert-created programs. Users receive adaptive workout and meal plans based on profile data and progress, can track activity over time, and purchase plans from verified sellers. Administrators manage users, moderate content, and ensure platform security. The system aims to deliver accessible wellness planning, trustworthy content commerce, and reliable operations.

\section{References}
This SRS was prepared in accordance with IEEE requirements engineering guidance (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018). These standards informed the organization, terminology, and conventions used herein.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
BurnLab is a new, self-contained web application that intermediates between buyers and sellers of digital fitness and nutrition content. It employs interconnected relational data models and presents a simple, intuitive interface suitable for a wide range of users.

\section{Product Functions}
Major functions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User onboarding and profile management (collecting age, weight, height, goals).
    \item Generation of personalized workout and meal plans that adapt over time.
    \item Progress logging and performance tracking with evolving recommendations.
    \item Marketplace for experts (trainers, nutritionists) to publish and sell programs.
    \item Secure browsing, comparison, and purchase of offerings by buyers.
    \item Administrative user/content management, moderation, and security oversight.
    \item Limited guest previews to encourage registration.
\end{itemize}

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Buyer:} Authenticates with email/password; browses, searches, purchases content; tracks progress.
    \item \textbf{Seller:} Manages product listings; views order artifacts for fulfillment.
    \item \textbf{Admin:} Superuser for user management, content moderation, dispute handling, and platform health.
\end{itemize}

\section{Operating Environment}
BurnLab targets modern desktop and mobile browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) and shall be responsive across device sizes.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
Initial deployment uses small-scale servers, limiting concurrency compared with large e-commerce sites. The stack includes Django, HTML, and CSS; Firebase provides cloud-hosted database services. Communications use HTTPS with TLS; passwords are stored with industry-standard hashing. Sellers must provide allergen information for applicable content.
