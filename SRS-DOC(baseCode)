\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) provides a detailed description of the features, constraints, and quality attributes of the BurnLab web platform. It is intended for project stakeholders and developers to guide design, implementation, verification, and validation activities.

\section{Document Conventions}
This document follows a consistent structure aligned to IEEE SRS conventions. Section headings are numbered hierarchically, with subsections used to enumerate specific requirements.

Plain text is used for general descriptions. \textbf{Bold text} is used to emphasize key terms or priorities.

All functional requirements are labeled with the prefix \textbf{REQ-} followed by a number (e.g., REQ-1, REQ-2) to provide unique identifiers for traceability. Unless otherwise specified, priorities defined at the feature level are inherited by their detailed requirements.

Fonts and styles are applied consistently, and all requirement statements are written as complete, unambiguous sentences.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading}
This SRS serves all stakeholders of the BurnLab platform. Developers should focus on \textbf{Chapter 3: System Features} and the \textbf{functional requirements} for implementation detail. Testers should use the same sections to derive test cases. Project managers can utilize the overall organization to track feature scope and priorities. Administrators and support staff can reference behavior expectations throughout. Marketing staff may use \textbf{Chapter 2: Overall Description} to understand product positioning and core functions.

A recommended sequence is: \textbf{Introduction (Chapter 1)} for scope, \textbf{Overall Description (Chapter 2)} for context, \textbf{System Features (Chapter 3)} for detailed behaviors, and \textbf{Other Nonfunctional Requirements (Chapter 4)} and \textbf{Other Requirements (Chapter 5)} for operational qualities, constraints, and compliance.

\section{Product Scope}
BurnLab provides meal and workout planning to support a healthy lifestyle. Plans are adaptable based on user preferences and characteristics, enabling personalized, goal-driven experiences.

\section{References}
This Software Requirements Specification was prepared in accordance with the 
IEEE standards for software requirements (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018). 
These standards guided the organization, terminology, and formatting conventions used 
throughout this document.

\section{Product Perspective}
BurnLab is a self-contained web application that intermediates between sellers and buyers of digital fitness and nutrition content. The platform employs interconnected relational databases and provides simple, intuitive interfaces suitable for users with a wide range of technical skills.

\section{Product Functions}
BurnLab enables users to create personalized fitness and nutrition experiences by collecting essential profile information (e.g., age, weight, height, and fitness goals) and generating tailored workout and meal plans that adapt over time. Users can log activity, track performance, and receive updated recommendations.

The platform includes a marketplace where trainers, nutritionists, and other experts can upload and sell programs, recipes, and plans. Buyers can explore offerings, compare options, and complete secure purchases.

Administrative functions include user management, content moderation, and platform security oversight. Guest visitors may preview limited content to encourage registration.

Together, these capabilities—personalized planning, a content marketplace, and administrative oversight—define BurnLab’s essential services.

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
The initial user classes are \textbf{Buyer}, \textbf{Seller}, and \textbf{Admin}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Buyer:} Authenticates with email and password to access marketplace content and purchase plans.
    \item \textbf{Seller:} Manages product listings (add, update, remove) and views order-related information for fulfillment.
    \item \textbf{Admin:} Acts as a superuser to manage users and content, moderate submissions, resolve disputes, and monitor system health.
\end{itemize}

\section{Operating Environment}
BurnLab targets modern desktop and mobile web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. The application shall be responsive to various device sizes and input modalities.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
BurnLab will initially operate on small-scale servers, limiting supported concurrent user counts relative to large-scale e-commerce platforms. The technology stack includes Django, HTML, and CSS. Firebase will be used as a cloud-hosted database. All communications will use HTTPS with TLS. Passwords will be protected via industry-standard hashing. Sellers must provide allergen information for applicable content to help users avoid harmful ingredients.
