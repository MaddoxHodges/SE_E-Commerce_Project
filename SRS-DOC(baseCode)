\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The software requirements specification is intended to provide a detailed explanation of the features and design specifications of this website. This document is intended for the stakeholders and developers of this website.

\section{Document Conventions}
This document follows a consistent structure and formatting style to make the requirements
clear and easy to reference. Section headings are numbered according to IEEE SRS
standards, with subsections used to break down specific requirements. 

Plain text is used for general descriptions. 
\textbf{Bold text} is used for emphasis on key terms or priorities. 

All functional requirements are labeled with the prefix \textbf{REQ-} followed by a number
(e.g., REQ-1, REQ-2) to provide a unique identifier for traceability. High-level priorities
defined in system features are inherited by their detailed requirements unless otherwise
stated. 

Fonts are standardized throughout the document for consistency, and requirements are
written in complete sentences to avoid ambiguity. 

\section{Intended Audience and Reading}
This SRS is designed to serve as an easy-to-understand framework for all stakeholders
involved with the BurnLab platform. It provides developers with a clear set of functional
and nonfunctional requirements to guide implementation. Project managers can use this
document to track progress and verify that all planned features align with business goals.
Marketing staff may refer to it to understand the scope of features and the value the
platform provides to end users. Testers will use the requirements to create test cases and
verify system functionality, while administrators and support staff can reference it for
understanding expected system behaviors.  

The document begins with an introduction and overall description of the product,
followed by detailed system features and functional requirements. These sections are
most useful to developers, testers, and managers who need a precise technical
understanding. The nonfunctional requirements and other requirements sections provide
guidance on performance, safety, security, and quality attributes, which are of interest to
both technical staff and project stakeholders.  

A recommended sequence for reading is to start with the Introduction (Section 1) to
understand the purpose and scope, proceed to the Overall Description (Section 2) for
context, then review the System Features (Section 3) for detailed requirements. Readers
concerned with long-term operation, maintainability, and compliance should pay special
attention to Other Nonfunctional Requirements (Section 4) and Other Requirements
(Section 5).


\section{Product Scope}
BurnLab would provide the meal and workout plans for customers to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The plan should be adaptable based on the preferences and characteristics of the users.

\section{References}
\textit{
}List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case
documents, or vision and scope documents. Provide enough information for the reader to access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
BurnLab is a self-contained website. BurnLab will be an intermediary between sellers and buyers of products.  The system of this web application will use methods of interconnected relational databases. Our users will have simple-to-understand interfaces so that anyone can use the website without confusion or a lack of technical skills.\textit{
}

\section{Product Functions}

BurnLab provides users with the ability to create personalized fitness and nutrition experiences. The platform will collect basic profile information such as age, weight, height, and fitness goals, then use this data to generate customized workout and meal plans. Users will be able to log their daily progress, track performance over time, and receive updated recommendations as they progress in their fitness journey. The system will also function as a marketplace, where sellers such as trainers and nutritionists can upload their own programs, recipes, and plans for purchase. Buyers will be able to browse available plans, compare options, and make secure purchases through the platform. Administrative functions will include user management, content moderation, and maintaining platform security. In addition, BurnLab will allow guest visitors to preview limited content to encourage registration. These core functions: personalized plan generation, progress tracking, content marketplace, and administrative oversight will define the essential services BurnLab must deliver. 

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
Buyers, Sellers, Admins, are the base user class which are going to be instated initially into the software. Buyers will have an email and password requirement to enter into the webstore's homepage. They will have access to the various meal plans and/or fitness plans sold by different sellers. In addition, sellers will have the ability to add and remove different products from our Webstore. Lastly, the Admin class is a general superuser with the ability to make direct contact with users and sellers, settling disputes and fixing bugs or errors in the buyer and seller experiences.\textit{ 
}

\section{Operating Environment}
BurnLab will be optimized for general web applications. Such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.\textit{ }

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
\textit{
}Burnlab is going to be using small scale servers, and as such, it will not be able to support a large number of users, as Amazon or eBay may be able to support.\textit{
}Burnlab will use Django, HTML, and CSS as the main languages for this project. As for the databases, we are using Firebase to serve as the cloud-hosted database. HTTPS and TLS encryption will be used to protect user data. Using hashing to protect data from bad actors and data leaks. Lastly, sellers must provide allergen data to alert any potential buyers of items to avoid.
